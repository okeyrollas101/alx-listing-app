# ALX Listing App

The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## Brief Explanation of my Project Folder

- **components/**: This file will define a reusable component that will be used across the project to display information about various properties i.e Card/Button component and as many reusable componenents that might be required.

- **interfaces/**: Define all TypeScript interfaces related to the project. Start by creating placeholder interfaces for CardProps and ButtonProps.

- **constants**/: Set up constants to store any reusable data or strings such as API URLs, configuration settings, or UI text

- **public/assets**: place the necessary images and SVG files that will be used across the project (such as placeholder property images).


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
